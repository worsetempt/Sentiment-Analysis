## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amazon-sentiment-analysis.git
    cd amazon-sentiment-analysis
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

## Usage

- **Jupyter Notebook:**  
  Open and run the notebook in the `notebooks/` folder for step-by-step analysis and modeling.

- **Python Script:**  
  To train or test the model via command line:
    ```
    python src/main.py
    ```

- **(Optional) Web App:**  
  If you have a Streamlit or Flask app:
    ```
    streamlit run src/app.py
    ```

## Results

- **Accuracy:** XX%
- **Precision / Recall / F1 Score:** XX / XX / XX
- **Sample Output:**
    ```
    Review: "This product is amazing!"
    Predicted Sentiment: Positive
    ```

- *(Add confusion matrix or sample plots if available)*

## Future Work

- Test with advanced models (e.g., LSTM, BERT)
- Deploy as a web application for real-time sentiment prediction
- Expand to multi-class sentiment (e.g., star ratings)
